# Interactive development and debugging with Flyte

In this recipe we will talk about how to interact with an existing Workflow or execution. This is not a tutorial for developing a Workflow interactively.

Alright, so we have a workflow or a task that is already registered. A registered workflow/task refers to those that were passed to register workflow or task. FlyteAdmin is aware of the name of the
Workflow or task and they can be retrieved using flyte-cli. So before get get started with the following steps, lets register workflows and tasks in this directory.

## Part 1: Executing a Pre-registered task

### Jupyter Notebook

### CLI (flyte-cli)

### Console

## Part 2:  Executing a Pre-registered Workflow / LaunchPlan

## Part 3: Retrevining outputs of error from a previous execution

### Jupyter Notebook

### Console

## Part 4: Relaunching a failed execution
