Feast
=====

Feast is an operational data system for managing and serving machine learning features to models in production.

Flyte provides a way to train models and perform feature engineering as a single pipeline. But, it provides no way to serve these 
features to production when the model matures and is ready to be served in production. This is where the integration between Flyte 
and Feast can help the users take their models and features from prototyping all the way to production cost-effectively and efficiently.
